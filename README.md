# Computer-Vision-Morphology
An demonstration of image processing and object extraction using mathematical morphological operators (dilation, erosion, opening, and closing)

# How to run

# Input
Provide two .txt input files representing grascale images and 3 text files to output to as command line arguments:
1) The input image
2) The structured element
3) Output file 1
4) Output file 2
5) Output file 3

### Here are example inputs: https://github.com/danielrand/Computer-Vision-Morphology/tree/master/sample/sampleInput1

# Output

### Console Output/Input:
You will be prompted to choose a morphological operation to perform on the input image using the input structured element.

### Output Files
The three outfiles you provided as input will be filled with the following
1) Just the foreground of the image
2) The structured element you provided
3) The result of the morphological operation you chose.

### Here are example output files, produced by the above input files: https://github.com/danielrand/Computer-Vision-Morphology/tree/master/sample/sampleOutput1
